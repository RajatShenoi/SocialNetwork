### Important information to contribute code:
- If an issue you're trying to solve is not already registered, please [create an issue](https://github.com/RajatShenoi/SocialNetwork/issues/new).
- Make sure you add a comment to that issue mentioning that you're working on it. This is done to make sure that multiple people do not spend time in fixing / adding the same thing.
- If you are interested in working on an issue that is already assigned to someone else, you may ping them to reach a solution amongst yourselves, such as collaborating on the same issue / working on it together. Kindly inform us when you do so, so that appropriate credit may be given to everyone involved.
- We may pass on an already assigned issue to someone else who's interested if the person who's already been assigned is **inactive** / cannot work on it any longer. If you've been assigned and are not able to implement it, please don't hesitate to let us know.
- Create a **fork** of this repository
- Create a **new branch** of the format `<issue-id>-<issue-title>`.
  - example: If the issue you're trying to solve has the title, *"fix accounts app"* and has the ID of *"56"*, kindly name your branch as `56-fix-accounts-app`.
- Make all the changes in that branch.
- Once you are ready, commit your changes. **Note:** All your commits must be signed. Learn how to [sign your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
- Once you have committed your changes, raise a Pull Request (PR).
- Once you've reached this stage, the Project Owner or other contributors might review your code and once it's approved and tested properly, your code will be merged to the main branch.
